# Setup Hardware

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 (4GB or 8GB RAM recommended)
  - The following setup instructions are tested with a Raspberry Pi 5. The system has worked completely on a RPi4, too, though.
- Arduino Micro 5V
  - In theory other Arduino boards that support they "keyboard.h" library should work, too. The setup has been tested with an Arduino Micro 5V.
- An USB-Audio Device
  - E.g. a Headset with an USB Audio Adapter or a USB Telephone Receiver
